## Tragedy Demands Seriousness — Not Exploitation

There is a serious and complex national conversation unfolding around the shooting death of **Renee Good** during an ICE enforcement operation. Any loss of human life is tragic, and incidents involving the use of deadly force by law enforcement **rightly warrant careful investigation, transparency, and accountability**.

At the same time, there is growing concern over how certain media outlets and commentators are **conflating facts, omitting key context, and framing this tragedy primarily as a political instrument** rather than a matter requiring disciplined inquiry.

When death is used to inflame outrage rather than to pursue truth, accountability becomes secondary — and public trust suffers.

## Holding Two Truths at Once

A healthy civic response must be capable of holding **two truths simultaneously**:

**First:**  
Any use of deadly force by law enforcement must be examined thoroughly and honestly. Accountability and due process are not optional; they are foundational to public trust.

**Second:**  
Context matters. If an individual interferes with a lawful law-enforcement operation in a manner that creates danger, that reality cannot be dismissed simply because it complicates a preferred narrative.

Acknowledging context does not excuse misconduct — but **ignoring context undermines credibility**.

## The Danger of Manufactured Martyrdom

Another troubling pattern has emerged: the effort to turn this tragedy into a **sacrificial-lamb narrative**.

When individuals or outlets selectively present only the most sympathetic elements of a person’s life — while excluding inconvenient or relevant facts — polarization becomes inevitable. In response, others feel compelled to expose what was omitted, not to dishonor the dead, but to correct an incomplete record.

This cycle does not produce understanding. It produces **division**.

There is a more honest and humane approach:  
**leave a person’s character intact, whatever it may be**.

None of us are the moral judge of another life — that role belongs to **God alone**. Like all people, Renee Good lived a life shaped by her own choices. If character is introduced into public discussion at all, intellectual honesty demands that the **entire picture be acknowledged**, not just the portions that serve a particular agenda.

## Truth Is Not the Enemy of Grief

It is both possible — and necessary — to **grieve a tragic loss while still insisting on truth**.

Justice cannot be built on selective facts.  
Unity cannot be forged through omission or exaggeration.

If we genuinely care about accountability, then we must care about **truth in its entirety**, not merely the parts that align with our political instincts.

That means resisting the urge to weaponize grief, rejecting narratives built on implication rather than evidence, and allowing investigations to proceed without pre-assigned verdicts.

## Accountability Without Hatred

A society committed to the rule of law must reject the false choice between compassion and clarity.

Honesty, restraint, and respect for lawful process are not obstacles to justice — they are the only path to it. Accountability achieved through truth strengthens communities. Accountability pursued through outrage fractures them.

Tragedy should lead us to understanding, not escalation.  
To discipline, not distortion.  
To accountability — **without hatred**.
