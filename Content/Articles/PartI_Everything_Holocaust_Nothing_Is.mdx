*This is **Part I** of a two-part response from **The Common Ledger**.  
Part II, **“Law, Language, and the Line We Must Not Cross,”** continues the analysis with historical and constitutional clarity.*

### There was a time when invoking the Holocaust stopped a conversation cold.

Not because it was rhetorically useful — but because it was morally weighty. It signaled that something *uniquely evil* had occurred in human history, something ***so extreme*** that comparison required extraordinary care.

That time appears to be over.

Today -  
- Immigration enforcement is called genocide
- Federal officers are compared to Nazis
- Detention facilities are labeled concentration camps
- Americans living under constitutional governance are likened to Anne Frank hiding from extermination.

These are not exaggerations for effect. They are **category errors** — and they carry consequences.

The problem is not *simply* that these comparisons are historically false. It is that they **retrain the moral instincts** of the public.

When everything becomes fascism - restraint stops feeling virtuous. When every arrest is tyranny - interference starts to feel heroic. When enforcement is genocide - escalation begins to feel justified.

This is how language does more than inflame emotion - it reshapes behavior.

### History shows us something deeply uncomfortable:
Mass harm does not begin with villains announcing themselves.

It begins when ordinary people are convinced that:
- Normal limits no longer apply
- Legality is meaningless
- Process is complicity
- Restraint is cowardice.

This is not how totalitarianism is resisted - it is how **social order frays**.

The Holocaust did not occur because citizens enforced public laws under judicial review. It occurred because *law was replaced by ideology, guilt became collective, and power escaped constraint*. To blur that distinction is not vigilance — it is **amnesia**.

And amnesia is dangerous.

### This is how moral distortion begins.

When we flatten moral categories, we lose the ability to tell the difference between abuse *and* enforcement, protest *and* obstruction, dissent *and* interference.

Tragedy follows — not because people are evil, but because they are convinced they are righteous.

Calling your country *genocidal* does not make you morally awake.

It makes you **reckless** with history — *and with human lives*.

If everything feels like tyranny, what standard will remain when tyranny actually arrives?

That question deserves more than slogans.

It deserves clarity.

*The Common Ledger exists to slow the conversation down — not to excuse abuse, but to preserve judgment when emotions run highest.*
