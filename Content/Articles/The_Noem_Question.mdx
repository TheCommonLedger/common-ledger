Calls to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security **Kristi Noem** have grown louder in recent weeks. The language is urgent. The accusations are sweeping. And the public is being asked—often in real time—to treat the word *impeachment* as if it were a verdict.

But impeachment is not a slogan. It is a **constitutional mechanism** with defined steps, legal standards, and political math. If we want accountability without hysteria, we have to separate three things:

1) what has actually been filed  
2) what the Constitution actually requires  
3) what is *likely* versus what is *being signaled*

## What’s Actually Happened

A resolution to impeach Secretary Noem **has been introduced** in the U.S. House of Representatives:

- **H.Res. 996 (119th Congress)** — introduced **January 14, 2026**  
  It proposes articles of impeachment and lays out allegations (including “Obstruction of Congress,” among other claims).  
  Read the official text here: [Congress.gov — H.Res. 996](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/996/text)

Separately, public pressure has continued to rise, including renewed calls for her removal and/or impeachment covered in major reporting as of **January 27, 2026**.  
(For reference reporting: [Reuters coverage](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-democratic-leaders-threaten-noem-with-impeachment-2026-01-27/))

**Key point:** “Calls for impeachment” and “a filed impeachment resolution” are not the same thing as impeachment *advancing* through the House.

## Can a Cabinet Secretary Be Impeached?

Yes.

The Constitution states that “**civil Officers of the United States**” may be impeached for “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Cabinet secretaries are generally understood to fall under “civil officers.”  
See: [Constitution Annotated — Offices eligible for impeachment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-2/section-4/offices-eligible-for-impeachment)

## What Impeachment Actually Requires

Impeachment is a **two-step process**:

1) **House**: approves articles of impeachment by a **simple majority**  
2) **Senate**: convicts and removes by a **two-thirds vote**

A clear overview is here: [USA.gov — How federal impeachment works](https://www.usa.gov/impeachment)

**This is the hard reality:**  
Even when impeachment articles exist on paper, conviction is rare without broad bipartisan agreement.

---

## What Counts as “High Crimes and Misdemeanors”?

It does **not** mean “a policy I strongly oppose.”

Historically, impeachment is aimed at serious misconduct: corruption, abuse of office, betrayal of public trust, criminal behavior, or defiance of lawful orders—conduct that is argued to rise to a constitutional level.

That doesn’t mean policy controversies can’t involve wrongdoing. It means the **standard is higher than outrage**, and the case must be built with facts that can withstand formal scrutiny.

## What to Verify Before Believing the Headlines

If you want to evaluate these calls honestly—without “team sports”—watch for **verifiable movement** in four places:

### 1) The House record (primary)
- Does H.Res. 996 move to committee action?
- Are hearings scheduled?
- Are subpoenas issued?
Use Congress.gov as the first reference point:
- [H.Res. 996 summary page](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/996)

### 2) DHS and DOJ actions (primary)
Impeachment is legislative. Criminal accountability is separate.
- Look for **DOJ charging decisions**, formal findings, or Inspector General developments (if any are announced).
- Look for **official DHS statements** and documented policy changes—not just commentary about them.

### 3) The White House position (primary)
When the executive branch responds, what matters most is what is put in official record—briefings, statements, published releases—not “heard from a source.”

### 4) Courts and injunctions (primary)
If a dispute is fundamentally about legality, the judiciary becomes a key arena. Track filed litigation and court orders, not viral claims.

## A Useful Historical Reminder

Impeaching cabinet officials is rare. One frequently cited historical case is Secretary of War **William Belknap (1876)**, impeached by the House after resigning; the Senate ultimately acquitted.  
See: [U.S. House History — Belknap impeachment](https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-Impeachment-of-Secretary-William-Belknap/)

This history doesn’t decide today’s case—but it does remind us that the word *impeachment* is often invoked more than it is successfully completed.

---

## The Bottom Line

Impeachment is constitutionally possible.  
A resolution has been introduced.  
But the leap from “calls” to “removal” is enormous—and it only happens through formal process, evidence, and votes.

If the facts ultimately justify removal, the case should be able to survive hearings, documentation, and cross-examination—*not just outrage cycles*.

And if the facts do **not** justify removal, then impeachment talk becomes something else: a signal, a narrative weapon, or a pressure tactic—often designed to produce **attention and alignment**, not a Senate conviction.
