## Introduction: Removing the Fog From a Loaded Term

Few phrases in modern American discourse are as frequently used—and as frequently misunderstood—as “sanctuary city.” To some, the term suggests lawlessness or defiance. To others, moral refuge. In reality, a sanctuary city is neither a suspension of federal law nor a shield against federal authority.

At its core, a sanctuary city reflects a legal posture grounded in constitutional federalism, not an exemption from immigration law. It rests on a specific and well-established principle: **state and local governments cannot be compelled to carry out federal law enforcement duties**
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="U.S. Constitution, Tenth Amendment">[1]</a></sup>.

That principle is lawful. At the same time, sanctuary policies do not authorize interference with federal law enforcement. Declining to participate is constitutionally protected. Obstructing federal action is not.

Understanding the distinction is essential.

## What Is a Sanctuary City?

### A Practical Definition

A sanctuary city (or county or state) is a jurisdiction that adopts policies limiting **voluntary cooperation** with federal immigration enforcement. These policies typically govern:

- Whether local law enforcement will honor ICE detainers (requests to hold individuals beyond their scheduled release)
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/section-287.7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="8 C.F.R. § 287.7">[2]</a></sup>

- Whether local agencies will collect, inquire into, or share immigration status  
- Whether local personnel will assist in civil immigration enforcement  

Importantly, “sanctuary city” is **not a legal designation found in federal statute**. It is a descriptive term applied to a range of local policy choices
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/17-2991/17-2991-2018-04-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="City of Chicago v. Sessions">[3]</a></sup>.

### Critics Often Misread This

Sanctuary is frequently described as a legal status or federal classification. It is neither. No federal statute designates or recognizes “sanctuary cities.”

### What Sanctuary Policies Are Not

A sanctuary city does **not**:

- Override federal immigration law  
- Bar federal agents from operating within its jurisdiction  
- Confer immunity from arrest or deportation  
- Create a legal “safe haven” from federal authority  

Federal immigration law applies nationwide, including within sanctuary jurisdictions.

## The Legal Foundation: Why Sanctuary Policies Exist

Sanctuary policies arise from the **anti-commandeering doctrine**, rooted in the Tenth Amendment and affirmed repeatedly by the Supreme Court.

### The Anti-Commandeering Principle

The Supreme Court has held that the federal government may **not require state or local governments to administer or enforce federal regulatory programs**
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/144/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="New York v. United States (1992)">[4]</a></sup>.

In *Printz v. United States* (1997), the Court ruled that Congress could not compel state law enforcement officers to carry out federal background check requirements. The principle was reaffirmed in *Murphy v. NCAA* (2018), which clarified that federal authority does not include issuing direct orders to state governments
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/898/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Printz v. United States">[5]</a></sup>
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/584/16-476/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Murphy v. NCAA">[6]</a></sup>.

Applied to immigration enforcement:

- Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility  
- States and municipalities may decline to participate  
- They may not be forced to use local resources, personnel, or budgets for federal purposes  

### Critics Often Misread This

Non-cooperation is often described as “nullification.” Courts have consistently rejected that framing. Declining to assist is not the same as invalidating federal law.

## What Is Legal Under Sanctuary Policies

When properly limited, sanctuary policies operate within established constitutional law.

### A. Declining Voluntary Cooperation

Local governments may lawfully choose:

- Not to honor ICE detainers unless accompanied by a judicial warrant  
- Not to hold individuals beyond their lawful release date solely for civil immigration purposes  
- Not to enter into 287(g) agreements deputizing local officers as federal immigration agents
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)">[7]</a></sup>

Courts have ruled that holding someone based solely on an ICE detainer—without a warrant—may violate the Fourth Amendment, exposing local jurisdictions to civil liability
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/oregon/ordce/3:2012cv02317/109778/59/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Miranda-Olivares v. Clackamas County">[8]</a></sup>.

### B. Limiting Use of Local Resources

Local governments retain authority over:

- Allocation of law enforcement resources  
- Information collected for local purposes  
- Whether immigration status is relevant to local policing  

These decisions fall within traditional state and municipal powers.

### C. Preserving Local Public Safety Priorities

Many jurisdictions justify sanctuary policies on public safety grounds, arguing that community trust is essential to effective policing. Courts have recognized this as a legitimate governmental interest.

## What Is Not Legal Under Sanctuary Policies

Sanctuary policies have clear constitutional and statutory limits.

### A. Obstructing Federal Law Enforcement

Local governments, officials, and private individuals may **not**:

- Physically block or impede federal officers  
- Warn individuals to evade lawful arrest  
- Interfere with execution of valid federal warrants  

Federal agents retain full authority to enforce federal law, including immigration law
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/18-55565/18-55565-2019-04-18.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="United States v. California">[9]</a></sup>.

### B. Harboring or Aiding Evasion

Federal law prohibits knowingly:

- Harboring individuals to prevent arrest  
- Concealing individuals from lawful enforcement  
- Assisting evasion of federal authorities  
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="8 U.S.C. § 1324">[10]</a></sup>

Sanctuary policies do not immunize anyone from these statutes.

### C. Attempting to Nullify Federal Law

Local governments may not:

- Declare federal immigration law unenforceable  
- Penalize compliance with lawful federal mandates  
- Regulate or punish federal officers acting within their authority  

The Supremacy Clause ensures federal law prevails where it lawfully applies.

## Federal Funding and Sanctuary Policies

### What the Federal Government Attempted

The Trump administration sought to condition federal grants on immigration enforcement cooperation and withhold funds from jurisdictions labeled as “sanctuary”
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/30/2017-02102/enhancing-public-safety-in-the-interior-of-the-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Executive Order 13768">[11]</a></sup>.

### What the Courts Decided

Federal courts ruled that:

- Only Congress may impose conditions on federal spending  
- The Executive Branch cannot unilaterally attach new funding conditions  
- Coercive funding threats violate constitutional separation of powers  
<sup class="citation"><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/17-17478/17-17478-2018-08-01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="City & County of San Francisco v. Trump">[12]</a></sup>

## Conclusion: What Sanctuary Cities Actually Represent

Sanctuary cities do not exist outside the law. They exist because of the law—specifically, constitutional limits on federal authority over state and local governments.

They represent:

- A lawful refusal to be commandeered  
- A choice about local resource allocation  
- An application of federalism, not defiance of federal authority  

At the same time, sanctuary policies do not authorize obstruction, interference, or nullification of federal law.

When stripped of rhetoric, the issue is not whether immigration laws apply—but **who is legally required to enforce them**.

## Publisher’s Note

The term “sanctuary city” has become one of the most politically charged phrases in modern American discourse. It is invoked frequently, often forcefully, and almost always without careful attention to its actual legal meaning.

Rather than arguing for or against sanctuary policies, this piece examines them through a narrow and disciplined lens: what the law allows, what it prohibits, and why those boundaries exist.

The Common Ledger exists to slow the conversation down—by separating what is constitutionally protected from what is not, and by returning public debate to first principles: evidence, law, and reason.
