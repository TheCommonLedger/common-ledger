Public discussion surrounding federal immigration enforcement has increasingly relied on absolutist language—either claiming federal officers possess total immunity from accountability or asserting that federal authority may be disregarded entirely.

**Neither position reflects the law.**

The legal reality is more precise: federal officers are protected when acting within the scope of their lawful duties—but not beyond them.

Understanding that distinction is essential to any serious discussion of federal authority.

## Context for Recent Statements

In recent remarks addressed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, **Stephen Miller**, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, stated in part:

> “You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties… You have immunity to perform your duties, and no one can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations.”

When read without legal context, such language has been interpreted by some as asserting **blanket immunity**. Under long-standing constitutional doctrine, however, federal immunity applies **only** when officers act within the scope of lawful federal authority.

No statute or court precedent supports immunity for unlawful conduct.

## The Constitutional Framework

### The Supremacy Clause

Article VI, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution—known as the **Supremacy Clause**—establishes that valid federal law supersedes conflicting state law.

This means states may not criminally punish federal officers for carrying out duties **authorized by Congress**.

### Supreme Court Precedent: *In re Neagle* (1890)

The Supreme Court articulated the governing rule in **_In re Neagle_**, holding that a federal officer is immune from state prosecution when actions are:

- Authorized by federal law, **and**
- Necessary and proper to perform official duties

📘 **In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1 (1890)**  
https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/135/1/

This doctrine remains controlling law today.

## The Limits of Federal Immunity

Federal supremacy does **not** confer unlimited protection.

ICE agents—like all federal officers—remain subject to:

- Constitutional constraints
- Federal criminal statutes
- Civil liability for unlawful conduct

When an officer exceeds legal authority, violates constitutional rights, or engages in criminal conduct, **immunity does not apply**.

### Civil Accountability

Federal officers may be held personally liable for constitutional violations under **_Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents_**.

📘 **Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971)**  
https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/

Qualified immunity protects officials only when the law was not clearly established—not when rights are knowingly violated.

## Obstruction and Interference With Federal Officers

Federal law draws a clear distinction between **lawful dissent** and **criminal interference**.

### What Is Prohibited

Federal statutes, including **18 U.S.C. § 111**, prohibit forcibly assaulting, resisting, or interfering with federal officers while engaged in official duties.

📜 **18 U.S.C. § 111**  
https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/111

Related statutes address obstruction and conspiracy:

- **18 U.S.C. § 1505** — Obstruction of proceedings  
  https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505
- **18 U.S.C. § 371** — Conspiracy against the United States  
  https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/371

### What Is Protected

Courts have consistently distinguished criminal obstruction from:

- Peaceful protest
- Lawful oversight
- Political disagreement
- Public criticism of policy

Only **physical interference, intimidation, or obstruction** triggers criminal liability.

## Clarifying the Legal Claim

Statements asserting that ICE officers are protected **while acting lawfully** are consistent with constitutional doctrine.

Statements suggesting **absolute or unconditional immunity** are not.

Stephen Miller’s remarks align with the law **only insofar as they are understood to apply to lawful conduct within federal authority**—a limitation imposed by the Constitution itself.

---

## Conclusion: Authority and Accountability Are Paired

The American legal system does not elevate enforcement above accountability, nor accountability above law.

Federal officers are protected **when they follow the law**.  
Citizens are protected **when officers do not**.

This balance is not accidental.  
It is constitutional.  
It is deliberate.  
And it is foundational.
