This explainer is for first-time voters, younger voters, new citizens, and anyone who was never clearly taught how U.S. elections work.

If you already know, this article may not be for you.
  
But many Americans were never given a plain-language explanation—and that matters in a democracy.

## What Is a Primary Election?

A **primary election** is how political parties choose their candidates *before* the general election in November.

**Primaries do not decide who holds office.**  
They decide **who each party will run** in the general election.

Think of primaries as the *selection process*, not the final outcome.

## A Simple Way to Think About It

Think of the **general election** as the final game.

The **primary election** is the tryout:

- Political parties are the teams  
- Candidates are the people trying out  
- Voters help decide who represents each team  

Only the candidates who win their party’s primary advance to November.

## What Does “Joint Primary” Mean?

A **joint primary** means multiple political parties hold their primaries on the same day, using the same election system.

They are still **separate contests**:

- Democrats vote for Democratic candidates  
- Republicans vote for Republican candidates  

Votes are **not** combined across parties.

## Who Can Vote in a Primary?

This depends on your state.

States generally fall into one of these categories:

- **Closed primaries**  
  Voters must be registered with a party to vote in that party’s primary.

- **Open primaries**  
  Voters may choose which party’s primary to vote in on election day.

- **Semi-open or semi-closed primaries**  
  Independents may participate, but party-registered voters may have restrictions.

The key point: **rules vary by state**, but the purpose is the same everywhere—choosing party nominees.

## What Are Voters Choosing in a Primary?

Depending on the election cycle, voters may choose nominees for:

- U.S. Congress (House and Senate)
- Governors
- State legislatures
- Judges (in states with judicial elections)
- Local offices

These are **not final winners**.  
They are candidates who move forward to the general election.

## Common Misconceptions

❌ **“The primary election decides who wins office.”**  
✅ No—it decides who *runs* in November.

❌ **“Primaries don’t really matter.”**  
✅ In many districts, the primary is just as important as the general election.

❌ **“Everyone already understands this.”**  
✅ Many voters were never taught how primaries work—especially first-time voters.

## Why Primary Elections Matter

Primary elections shape the choices voters see later.

They are one of the **earliest points** where citizens can directly influence:

- Which ideas gain momentum  
- Which candidates receive party support  
- Which options appear on the general-election ballot  

Understanding primaries is a form of **civic power**.

## Final Thought

An informed voter is not a partisan voter.  
An informed voter is an **empowered** voter.

Understanding how primaries work helps ensure that your voice matters *before* the choices are narrowed.

That’s civic participation at its most basic—and most important.
